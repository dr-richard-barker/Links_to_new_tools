# Microbiome analysis tools in the cloud

{% embed url="https://nmdc-edge.org/home" %}

The National Microbiome Data Collaborative ([NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/)) supports a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) microbiome data sharing network through infrastructure, data standards, and community building to address pressing challenges in environmental sciences. The NMDC EDGE (Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise) platform was created so that all researchers can access and process their â€˜omics data using the NMDC standardized bioinformatics workflows, regardless of resource availability or expertise level. All microbiome datasets in the [NMDC Data Portal](https://data.microbiomedata.org/) have been processed using the same workflows as those housed in NMDC EDGE, allowing datasets to be directly compared between the two interfaces.



A [Quick Start Guide](https://nmdc-edge.org/docs/help/quickStart.pdf) along with other [Tutorials and User Guides](https://nmdc-edge.org/tutorial) are available for running workflows in NMDC EDGE. The full [NMDC documentation site](https://nmdc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides more specific information about the NMDC workflows and their associated tools and parameters. NMDC EDGE can either be installed locally or the workflows can be run online using shared NMDC computing resources.



We are continuously collecting feedback and information on user experiences with the workflows and the NMDC EDGE platform. Please provide feedback via this [feedback form](https://forms.gle/rMhjPj8PoyhhWWKD8).



For any issues or questions that require support from a team member, please contact _nmdc-edge@lanl.gov_ or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-edge).
